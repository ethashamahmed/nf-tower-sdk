Python SDK for [Nextflow Tower API](https://help.tower.nf/22.3/api/overview/#programmatic-api). The purpose of this SDK is to provide programmatic access to Tower API endpoints.

## What You Get

1. Client Library for Nextflow Tower API autogenerated using [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client).
2. Nextflow Tower client object for interacting with API endpoints.

## Project status

Alpha version for this project is under active development.

## Setting up local environment

Use [Makefile](./Makefile) to setup local development environment.
Unit tests currently use Seqera's [NF Tower community](https://tower.nf)
installation instead of mocking the API. This is to enable
verification of the API calls
through an actual Tower API during initial development.
So running tests locally requires this environment variable:
`NFT_API_TOKEN=<your_api_token_for_nextflow_tower>`.
See [NF Tower docs](https://help.tower.nf/22.4/api/overview/#authentication)
for how to create your API token.
